# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to TaskFlow GTD! This guide will help you get started with the GTD/PARA system in 5 minutes.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Quick Capture (30 seconds)
1. Press `Cmd+N` (Mac) or `Ctrl+N` (Windows) from anywhere
2. Type what's on your mind
3. Hit Enter
4. Repeat for everything in your head

**Pro tip**: Don't think too hard - just capture everything!

### Step 2: Process Your Inbox (2 minutes)
1. Click "Inbox" in the navigation
2. For each item, ask: "Is it actionable?"
   - **Yes** → Choose context (@home, @office, etc.) and continue
   - **No** → File as Reference, Someday/Maybe, or Delete

### Step 3: Work from Next Actions (2 minutes)
1. Click "Next Actions" in the navigation
2. Filter by your current context (e.g., @home)
3. Pick a task that matches your energy level
4. Check it off when done!

## 📍 Understanding Contexts

Contexts are WHERE or WITH WHAT you can do a task:

- **@home** - Tasks requiring you to be at home
- **@office** - Tasks needing office resources
- **@phone** - Calls you need to make
- **@computer** - Computer-based work
- **@errands** - Tasks to do while out

**Example**: "Buy milk" = @errands, "Email boss" = @computer

## ⚡ Energy Levels

Match tasks to how you feel:

- **🔥 High Energy** - Creative work, problem-solving, important decisions
- **⚡ Medium Energy** - Regular work tasks, meetings, routine projects  
- **🌱 Low Energy** - Email, filing, simple administrative tasks

## 📁 PARA Categories

Organize your projects by type:

1. **Projects** - Things with specific outcomes and deadlines
   - "Plan vacation to Japan"
   - "Complete tax return"
   - "Launch new website"

2. **Areas** - Ongoing responsibilities you maintain
   - "Health & Fitness"
   - "Finances"
   - "Family"

3. **Resources** - Reference materials for the future
   - "Gift ideas"
   - "Recipes to try"
   - "Investment research"

4. **Archive** - Completed or inactive items
   - Finished projects
   - Old references
   - Past areas

## 🎯 Daily Workflow

2. Open Next Actions
3. Filter by today's contexts
4. Identify 3 most important tasks

### Throughout the Day

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Capture Tips
- **Be specific**: "Call John about Q4 budget" not just "John"
- **Use verbs**: Start tasks with action words
- **One task per item**: Break down complex tasks
- **Don't filter**: Capture now, organize later

### Processing Tips
- **2-minute rule**: If it takes less than 2 minutes, do it now
- **Batch similar tasks**: Process all @phone calls together
- **Trust the system**: If it's captured, you won't forget it

### Context Tips
- **Current location first**: Start with tasks you can do NOW
- **Energy awareness**: High energy in morning? Do creative tasks
- **Time boxing**: Got 15 minutes? Filter for quick tasks

## 🔄 Weekly Review (30 minutes)

Every week, spend 30 minutes to:

1. **Get Clear** (10 min)
   - Process inbox to zero
   - Check calendar

2. **Get Current** (15 min)
   - Review each project
   - Ensure next actions exist
   - Check "Waiting For" list

3. **Get Creative** (5 min)
   - Review "Someday/Maybe"
   - Add new ideas
   - Activate ready projects

## 🎉 You're Ready!

That's it! You now know enough to start using GTD effectively. Remember:

1. **Capture** everything (Cmd+N)
2. **Process** to the right place
3. **Review** by context and energy
4. **Do** with confidence

The system will become second nature within a week of regular use.

## 🆘 Need Help?
