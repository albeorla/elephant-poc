## Testing Gap Analysis

### Well-Tested Areas
- All API endpoints (>95% coverage)
- Business logic and data flows
- Integration scenarios
- Error conditions
- Authentication flows

### Testing Gaps Requiring Attention
1. **Theme Switching** - No tests for UI preference persistence
2. **Responsive Design** - No viewport or mobile interaction tests
3. **Accessibility** - No ARIA or keyboard navigation tests
4. **Performance** - Limited real-world performance testing
5. **Browser Compatibility** - No cross-browser tests

### Recommended Test Additions

## Recommendations

### Feature Simplification
1. **Consider removing Labels** - Projects provide sufficient organization
2. **Simplify priority system** - Use just High/Normal or rely on due dates
3. **Make sections optional** - Hide by default to reduce complexity

### Testing Priorities
1. **Add E2E tests** for critical user journeys
2. **Test responsive design** across devices
3. **Add accessibility tests** for compliance
4. **Test theme switching** for persistence
