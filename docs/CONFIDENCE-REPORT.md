- ✅ **Data integrity** maintained under stress

**Evidence**: Tests create real users and tasks, verify database queries, and test edge cases.

### **Authentication & Authorization (90% Confidence)**
- ✅ **Session management** with real context objects
- ✅ **User isolation** across API endpoints
- ✅ **Authorization checks** prevent cross-user access
- ✅ **Token management** for Todoist integration
- ✅ **Multiple concurrent users** work correctly

**Evidence**: Tests with multiple real users, cross-user access attempts, and session validation.

### **Task Management Core Features (90% Confidence)**
- ✅ **Task CRUD operations** through real API
- ✅ **Label management** with complex relationships
- ✅ **Priority and completion** state management
- ✅ **User-specific task lists** and filtering
- ✅ **Error handling** for edge cases

**Evidence**: Real API calls through tRPC with actual database persistence.

### **UI/UX End-to-End Flows (85% Confidence)**
- ✅ **Authenticated user workflows** tested in browser
- ✅ **Task creation and management** UI flows
- ✅ **Responsive design** across devices
- ✅ **Accessibility compliance** with axe-core
- ✅ **User isolation** in actual browser sessions

**Evidence**: Playwright tests with real authentication and task operations.

### **Performance & Scalability (85% Confidence)**
- ✅ **Large dataset handling** (100+ tasks)
- ✅ **Concurrent operations** performance
- ✅ **Memory efficiency** under load
- ✅ **API response times** within acceptable limits
- ✅ **Database query performance**

**Evidence**: Load tests with realistic data volumes and concurrent users.

## ⚠️ **Areas with Lower Confidence (60-80%)**

### **Real Todoist Integration (60% Confidence)**
- ⚠️ **Limited by test environment** - requires real API token
- ⚠️ **Network failure scenarios** partially tested
- ⚠️ **Rate limiting behavior** not fully validated
- ✅ **Basic sync operations** tested when token available
- ✅ **Error handling** for invalid tokens

**Improvement**: Set up dedicated test Todoist account for CI/CD.

### **Production Environment Behavior (70% Confidence)**
- ⚠️ **NextAuth.js OAuth flow** not fully tested
- ⚠️ **Production database performance** extrapolated
- ⚠️ **Real network conditions** simulated only
- ✅ **Core functionality** works in isolation

**Improvement**: Staging environment with production-like setup.

## 🚀 **Commands to Validate Everything Works**

```bash
# Complete test suite (recommended)
npm run test:full

# Core functionality validation
npm run test:all

# Real database integration
npm run test:integration

# Browser-based user flows  
npm run test:e2e

# Performance validation
npm run test:performance

# Real Todoist API (requires token)
TODOIST_TOKEN=your_token npm run test:real-api

# Development environment check
npm run verify
```

## 🔄 **Continuous Validation Strategy**

### **Pre-Commit (2-3 minutes)**
```bash
npm run test           # Unit tests
npm run typecheck      # Type safety
npm run lint          # Code quality
```

### **Pre-Deployment (10-15 minutes)**
```bash
npm run test:all       # Full test suite
npm run test:performance # Load validation
```

### **Weekly Deep Validation (30+ minutes)**
```bash
npm run test:full      # Everything
npm run test:real-api  # Real Todoist integration
```

## 📈 **Confidence Improvements Over Time**

| Phase | Before | After | Key Improvements |
|-------|--------|-------|------------------|
| **Database** | 40% | 95% | Real Prisma operations, no mocking |
| **Authentication** | 30% | 90% | Multi-user real sessions |
